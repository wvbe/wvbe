### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wybe, I am a Netherlands-based person in the professional internet spheres. I have been with
[Fonto](https://fontoxml.com) since we began as a startup, initially as an interaction designer and later as a
developer, trainer and currently as product owner.
[My LinkedIn profile would tell you more](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wybeminnebo/).

My professional life bleeds into hobby life, where I dabble with code relating to XML technologies, command-line
interfaces, Node or Deno. See also the software I maintain here on GitHub.

I have public profiles on [github][github], [npmjs][npmjs], [linkedin][linkedin], [facebook][facebook],
[instagram][instagram], [medium][medium], [twitter][twitter].
